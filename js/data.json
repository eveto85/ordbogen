     "Gabriel Zaid"

    "publisher": "Paul Dry Books",
    "description": "\"Gabriel Zaid's defense of books is genuinely exhilarating. It is not pious, it is wise; and its wisdom is delivered with extraordinary lucidity and charm. This is how Montaigne would have written about the dizzy and increasingly dolorous age of the Internet. May So Many Books fall into so many hands.\"—Leon Wieseltier \"Reading liberates the reader and transports him from his book to a reading of himself and all of life. It leads him to participate in conversations, and in some cases to arrange them…It could even be said that to publish a book is to insert it into the middle of a conversation.\"—from So Many Books Join the conversation! In So Many Books, Gabriel Zaid offers his observations on the literary condition: a highly original analysis of the predicament that readers, authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians, and teachers find themselves in today—when there are simply more books than any of us can contemplate. \"With cascades of books pouring down on him from every direction, how can the twenty-first-century reader keep his head above water? Gabriel Zaid answers that question in a variety of surprising ways, many of them witty, all of them provocative.\"—Anne Fadiman, Author of Ex-Libris \"A truly original book about books. Destined to be a classic!\"—Enrique Krauze, Author of Mexico: Biography of Power, Editor of Letras Libres \"Gabriel Zaid's small gem of a book manages to be both delectable and useful, like chocolate fortified with vitamins. His rare blend of wisdom and savvy practical sense should make essential and heartening reading for anyone who cares about the future of books and the life of the mind.\"—Lynne Sharon Schwartz, Author of Ruined by Reading: A Life in Books \"Gabriel Zaid is a marvelously elegant and playful writer—a cosmopolitan critic with sound judgment and a light touch. He is a jewel of Latin American letters, which is no small thing to be. Read him—you'll see.\"—Paul Berman \"'So many books,' a phrase usually muttered with despair, is transformed into an expression of awe and joy by Gabriel Zaid. Arguing that books are the essential part of the great conversation we call culture and civilization, So Many Books reminds us that reading (and, by extension, writing and publishing) is a business, a vanity, a vocation, an avocation, a moral and political act, a hedonistic pursuit, all of the aforementioned, none of the aforementioned, and is often a miracle.\"—Doug Dutton \"Zaid traces the preoccupation with reading back through Dr. Johnson, Seneca, and even the Bible ('Of making many books there is no end'). He emerges as a playful celebrant of literary proliferation, noting that there is a new book published every thirty seconds, and optimistically points out that publishers who moan about low sales 'see as a failure what is actually a blessing: The book business, unlike newspapers, films, or television, is viable on a small scale.' Zaid, who claims to own more than ten thousand books, says he has sometimes thought that 'a chastity glove for authors who can't contain themselves' would be a good idea. Nonetheless, he cheerfully opines that 'the truly cultured are capable of owning thousands of unread books without losing their composure or their desire for more.'\"—New Yorker",

    ],
    "publisher": "Xlibris Corporation",
    "publishedDate": "2012-09-01",
    "description": "The Pilgrimage The first section of the story of Akhenaten is told by Ambrose, the soul self of Akhenaten/Smenkhkare. He begins by speaking of the distant beginnings of Earth's evolvement and that of all earlier species and the divine orchestration behind all of Earth's evolvement and adorning.' Thereafter he speaks of Amilius Hermes and the Great Division that was brought about the creative experimentation indulged in by a certain group of Divine Brethren (not of the angelic realm). From there he speaks of the pilgrimages that were required in divine reparation and healing, that which brought about the Hermetic vibration. He goes on to speak of the returning pilgrimages by the incarnate visitations of the extra-terrestrially evolved Hermetic vibration as well as those who eventually incarnated solely upon Earth. Soon he comes to speaking briefly of his overlapping dual incarnations as the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten and his brother Prince Smenkhkare and their soul's close connection with Amilius Hermes and the Hermetic vibration. And so he finishes by summing up his own soul self's spiritual lineage and a brief address to the reader of his story. Meritaten It is Meritaten who tells the second section of the story and therein she gives her account of her father Akhenaten and his life. She tells us of her father and includes details of her own life and that of her beloved sisters and soon informs us that when she was born she already had two older sisters. She also speaks of her mother Nefertiti and even twice briefly mentions her beloved grandmother Tiy and grandfather Amenophis III. Of course she in due time speaks adoringly of the two loves of her life, her husband Prince Smenkhkare (and later the Pharaoh Smenkhkare) and her son Tutankhaten (Tutankhamun). Near the beginning of her story she informs us that she and her sisters were all taught not only to write detailed stories but also to perform them. Meritaten is a consummate story teller with a great sense of place and a sometimes poetic turn of phrase. Her account expresses the whole range of their human experience amid the fine detail of their physical surroundings. She ranges from poignant and touching, often amusing and right through to her own personal traumatic emotional pain and thereafter to the gradual tragedy all of their lives eventually became. (Keep in mind that Meritaten and Tutankhaten were the dual soul aspects of Ambrose's twin self Ursu). Tutankhaten And now it is (Tutankhamun) who takes up the telling of the third and final part of the story of Akhenaten, speaking from the position he assumed when having incarnated as Akhenaten's only son. He speaks openly about the fact that thereafter Akhenaten and Smenkhkare's deaths he was soon forcibly renamed Tutankhamun when crowned. Even from the very beginning of his account he decidedly states that his true name was and is Tutankhaten. While sharing his memories of his father, he also tells very well the story of his own short lifetime and that of his adored mother Meritaten and Smenkhkare whom he fondly called his second-father. His amiable half-sisters he speaks of also, and later of his grandmother Nefertiti and her brother the universally despised Ay. The latter being his greatest oppressor. And last but certainly far from least, we are privy to a most fervently detailed account of the unenviable relationship between himself and his beloved half-sister and queen Ankhesenapaaten (who was also forcibly renamed Ankhesenamun). And that they had been compelled to marry under such duress he also refers to their life as captives of state, those living within a luxuriously appointed prison. Like his mother Meritaten he later recounts his experiences after passing over into Spirit, although his personal experiences were quite different from hers in that they contain strong elements of both the dark and the light.
